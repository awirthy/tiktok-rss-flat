    <content>You've probably heard the Government's "1.2 million new homes over 5 years" announcement. We've done the analysis! Verdict: It's better than nothing. But that's not saying much. Matt and Greg explain. "From 2014-19, there were 1.05 million houses built. So this announcement is only 150,000 more than already expected." "Are they going to actually build 1.2 million homes themselves?"  "No, they're going to provide incentives to people to build homes and invest in homes. They seem to want to spend billions and billions of dollars, but at the end of it theyâ€™ll own no houses. Frankly, it is a pretty strange thing to do." Taken from our live show Nation in a Nutshell (available in full on YouTube).</content>

    <title>Gas as a transition fuel?  Doesn't really make sense, when the proposed Middle Arm LNG facility will have lifecycle emissions equal to 12 coal-fired power stations.  #auspol #climatechange</title>

    <title>Think offsets are our way to Net-Zero? Think again. The majority of carbon offsets are flawed, they aren't used to cover all emissions, and we're even dramatically underestimating our emissions. #auspol #climatechange</title>

    <content>"If we say Yes now, we can listen to their priorities and needs, and we as a nation can begin to come together after decades of growing apart."  In less than a minute, Richard Denniss, executive director of the Australia Institute explains the simple reasons why we are supporting the Voice to Parliament. Here's the facts: The polling shows more than 80% of Indigenous Australians support the Voice.   It was first proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is the culmination of over a decade of work and extensive First Nations consultation which arrived at a consensus about what constitutional recognition should look like. Twelve deliberative dialogues were conducted involving a total of 1,200 First Nations people drawn from local traditional owners, First Nations community-based organisations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. These regional dialogues then selected their own representatives to attend the First Nations Constitutional Convention at Uluru in 2017, where First Nations forged a historic consensus on what constitution recognition should look like, adopting the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The Statement is an invitation from First Nations people to all Australians. One of its key features is to ask Australians to support meaningful constitutional recognition by providing a First Nations Voice. We're proud to support the Yes vote in the upcoming Voice referendum. #WriteYes #auspol #yes23 #fyp</content>
