    <title>Why is it so important to have the Voice in the Constitution? "Every organisation that we've set up has been done away in an afternoon, signed away." "Stability, so we can properly participate in the political &amp; social life of the nation."  - Pat Anderson</title>

    <content>You've probably heard the Government's "1.2 million new homes over 5 years" announcement. We've done the analysis! Verdict: It's better than nothing. But that's not saying much. Matt and Greg explain. "From 2014-19, there were 1.05 million houses built. So this announcement is only 150,000 more than already expected." "Are they going to actually build 1.2 million homes themselves?"  "No, they're going to provide incentives to people to build homes and invest in homes. They seem to want to spend billions and billions of dollars, but at the end of it theyâ€™ll own no houses. Frankly, it is a pretty strange thing to do." Taken from our live show Nation in a Nutshell (available in full on YouTube).</content>

    <title>Think offsets are our way to Net-Zero? Think again. The majority of carbon offsets are flawed, they aren't used to cover all emissions, and we're even dramatically underestimating our emissions. #auspol #climatechange</title>
