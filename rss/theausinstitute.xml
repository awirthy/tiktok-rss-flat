    <title>Let us just say it for what it is: CCS is a scam. It is a scam that has been used by the coal and gas industries to con (usually willing) governments and populations into delaying climate action. #auspol #climatechange</title>

    <content>You've probably heard the Government's "1.2 million new homes over 5 years" announcement. We've done the analysis! Verdict: It's better than nothing. But that's not saying much. Matt and Greg explain. "From 2014-19, there were 1.05 million houses built. So this announcement is only 150,000 more than already expected." "Are they going to actually build 1.2 million homes themselves?"  "No, they're going to provide incentives to people to build homes and invest in homes. They seem to want to spend billions and billions of dollars, but at the end of it theyâ€™ll own no houses. Frankly, it is a pretty strange thing to do." Taken from our live show Nation in a Nutshell (available in full on YouTube).</content>
