    <content>Canada Has India Dead To Rights #canada #india #usa  Canada has India dead to rights in the murder of a Canadian citizen. The Canadian government &amp; an unidentified Five Eyes member reportedly amassed tons of intelligence on India including communications involving Indian officials themselves, including Indian diplomats present in Canada. This reportedly includes texts and recorded calls. Also Canadian officials say that when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation. The US now says that India will not get a free pass after public pressure mounted over the US’ initially staying silent over the row. President Biden reportedly raised the issue with Modi at the G20 which means that the evidence that India murdered a Canadian is rock solid enough for the President of the United States to take action on it.</content>

    <content>US Navy Is Creating UFOs #usa #america  The US Navy may be creating UFOs unintentionally and that is likely why there are increasing sightings. For at least the past two decades, the US Navy has been researching Laser-Plasma and 3 years ago, they patented the technology. It’s supposed to protect stealth aircraft by using bursts of laser plasma to create or project mid-air images, these images will trick incoming missiles into hitting the hologram. These holograms, for lack of a better term, can be picked up in several wavelengths including infrared and can appear as real objects in them. This technology has also been used to create laser-plasma balls that can transmit human speech, whatever that means. Perhaps the Pentagon changing the term from UFO, unidentified flying object, to UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena, is further evidence of this. So it seems like aliens are once again not real but who’s to say.</content>

    <content>Russia Rejects Peace, Wants To Settle It On Battlefield #ukraine #russia  Russia has rejected Ukraine’s peace plan because they want to “settle it on the Battlefield” instead. Just this past week, Ukraine struck the Black Sea Headquarters in Crimea - killing the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. Meanwhile American tanks have finally arrived in Ukraine with Depleted uranium rounds. And while Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been moving slower than expected, their shaping operation in Crimea has seen great success.</content>

    <content>Canadian Pilot Changes Call Sign To What?! #canada #uk  Yesterday a Canadian fighter jet changed its call sign to “D**K69” while it was flying over the UK. Canada says it’s investigating the name change, adding that it was inappropriate and unapproved. Call signs contain four letters and two numbers. They are assigned to pilots and usually remain unchanged. And this Canadian pilot changed their call sign from BLDE11 to D**K69. They could be facing a stiff punishment.</content>
