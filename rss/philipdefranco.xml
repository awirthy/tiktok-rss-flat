    <content>Poland And Belarus Are Ready To Fight #poland #russia  Poland has moved its troops to the border of Belarus due to the deployment of Wagner in the country. They’ve called the joint exercises of Belarus and Wagner a provocation. Germany says it’s prepared to defend Poland against Belarussian aggression. And Russia says that preparing to defend against Belarus is preparing to defend against Russia. And that they will respond to this with all means at their disposal. Putin himself said today that Poland was a gift from Stalin and that Poland has forgotten about that. Adding that Poland dreams of conquering Belarus and Ukraine.</content>

    <content>Russia Buzzes Another US Plane #usa #russia  Russia has buzzed yet another US plane. Earlier this week Russia flew dangerously close to a manned US spy plane over Syria and endangered the lives of 4 Americans. This comes as Russia is attempting to break a record of harassment, after they’ve harassed the US’s drones, planes, and troops over 5 times this month by dropping fuel on them, buzzing them, and dropping flares on them. The US has urged Russia to cut it out, saying that Russia should act like a professional air force so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of.</content>

    <content>Ukraine To Sink All Ships Going To Russia #ukraine #russia  Ukraine is now threatening a tit-for-tat against Russia after Russia threatened to sink civilian vessels traveling to Ukraine. With Ukraine now saying that all ships heading to Russia will be considered to be carrying military cargo with all corresponding risks. This comes after Russia blew up over 60,000 tons of grain meant for China in a Ukrainian port. Russia’s goal is to scare ships from going to Ukrainian ports and now Ukraine is doing the same to Russia. What a fun time to be a fisherman in the Black Sea</content>

    <content>Wagner Wants To Invade Poland #poland #russia  Wagner wants to invade Poland! Belarus says Wagner is stressing them out because they want to invade Poland and that they’ve been “bugging” them to strike Warsaw. And Belarus says it’s been begging them not to and that they’re having a hard time controlling them. There are few things the extremely capable Polish military would enjoy more than erasing every member of Wagner stupid enough to cross their border.</content>

    <content>UN Trying To Save US Soldier From North Korea #usa #korea  The UN has begun talks with North Korea about Travis King, the U.S. soldier who ran into North Korea. King hasn’t been seen since he ran across the border and was shoved into a van and driven off by North Korean soldiers. The US says they’re not ruling out that he contacted North Korea beforehand but currently they don’t believe he was in prior contact. New reports suggest that there was a 13 hour gap between when he escaped the airport and when he crossed into the North. North Korea has so far refused to talk to the U.S. about the issue.</content>
