    <content>Canada Preparing For A Fascist America #usa #canada  Canada says it’s creating a game plan for how to respond and deal with the United States if it takes a far-right authoritarian shift in next year’s Presidential election. They worry that the two Republican front runners will pull the US out of NATO and all of its other treaties including trade agreements, leaving Canada to fend for itself. They declined to comment on what the plan would look like but Europe and Canada have been strengthening ties since the Trump Presidency due to this explicit scenario. If push comes to shove, they could always build a wall.</content>

    <content>Ukraine Destroys Russian Supersonic Bomber #ukraine #russia  Ukraine has destroyed Russia’s supersonic bomber. Now Russia claims it’s only damaged, but judging by the photo. Looks pretty bad to me. Russia called this a terrorist act but hitting a bomber on a military base is the furthest thing from terrorism. A terrorist act is hitting entire apartment buildings with missiles like this supersonic bomber has done since the beginning of the war.</content>

    <content>Algeria Blocks French Airforce #france #algeria  Algeria says France can’t fly military aircraft over the country in order to conduct a “military operation” in Niger. France responded by saying “cool, we never asked for such a thing”. 12 nigerien soldiers, as in soldiers from Niger, were killed in a terrorist ambush, that’s the 8th terrorist attack on the Army since the coup happened. Also the African Union has kicked Niger out of the union due to the coup and the new US ambassador has arrived in the country but they won’t be meeting with the Junta.</content>

    <content>Russia Killed Leader Of Wagner #russia #ukraine  Russia has killed the leader of Wagner. Russian state media says Prigo as well as at least 9 others passengers died when his jet crashed. Wagner is accusing Russia of shooting down the plane as he was leaving Moscow today. Initial flight data and video evidence seems to back that accusation. Wagner’s military commander is also reportedly among the dead. The CIA doesn’t call Putin the “ultimate Apostle of payback” for no reason.</content>

    <content>Wagner To Get Revenge On Russia For Leader’s Death #russia #ukraine  Wagner says the Kremlin will now be captured after Russia killed the group’s leader. Shortly after Prigo’s death, Putin was seen joyfully speaking at a public event. Russia has opened a criminal investigation into the crash. Some Russian officials have blamed Ukraine but Wagner is pinning the blame straight on the Kremlin. The Pentagon says no one should be surprised that Prigo is dead. Biden says that he’s not surprised and that not much happens in Russia that Putin isn’t behind. It’s unclear if Putin will try to claim the $250,000 bounty the FBI had on Prigo</content>
