    <content>India and Canada Continue To Fall Out Over Murder Of Sikh Leader #canada #india #usa  Canada has briefed the US, UK, and France over India’s killing of a Canadian Sikh Leader in Canada. Canada has expelled an Indian diplomat they believe is India’s head spy over the killing. India has retaliated by kicking out a Canadian diplomat. Canada has halted trade negotiations and postponed its trade mission in response to the killing. In a statement India said the accusation is “absurd and motivated.” And alleged Canada is continuing to give shelter to anti-Indian terrorists and that they refuse to do anything about it. The Canadian ambassador to India was also summoned, he was seen storming out of the building angrily and slamming his car door. Canada is urging its citizens to avoid traveling to India. Meanwhile, Indian TV has labeled their intelligence service “the new Mossad”. Canada has been pressuring 5 eyes to raise the murder with India in recent months, and they allegedly did privately last week. But It also asked them to release a joint statement condemning the action, and its allies, including the United States, have declined. This is in spite of the US helping Canadian intelligence discover India’s action. Yesterday, the U.S. said that it was deeply concerned about the killing and that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Australia said that they raised the issue with India and expressed their deep concern. This comes at a particularly awkward time. As the US-led West has been courting India to be a strategic counterweight to China and are trying to avoid antagonizing them. Earlier this year, India demanded that the U.S. and UK break up protests outside of their embassies and when the countries said that wasn’t something they could do - they removed the concrete barriers in front of the British embassy in India to punish them. Many have pointed out that India seems to think it can act with impunity &amp; push around everyone in the West except the United States and so for the US to stay quiet as India bullies its allies, it sends the wrong message. The United States would better serve its allies and the values it claims to stand for if it condemned India and backed up its closest ally instead of playing coy.</content>

    <content>Ukraine Conducts Special Forces Operation In Sudan #ukraine #russia  Ukrainian Special Forces reportedly conducted several drone attacks and ground operations against a Wagner-backed milita in Sudan according to CNN. The rapid support forces are a militia in Sudan, backed by Wagner. Several US officials expressed surprise and were unaware of the operation when asked about it today. Sudan claims that such operations never happened but the drone does appear to be Ukrainian due to the on screen text, however that hasn’t been verified. If true, this is further evidence that the war is expanding beyond the two’s borders and moving globally. Such a move is thought by some to be a favor for one of Russia’s African allies in an attempt to pry them away from Russia.</content>

    <content>Biden Met With The Stans #usa #swiftie  Biden met with the stans yesterday, and I’m not talking about the Barbs or the Swifties. Nope, I’m talking about Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. This is the first C5+1 summit in Presidential history. They discussed stronger regional security, connectivity, climate action, and governance. Central Asia asked Washington to not forget about them when they left Afghanistan, and sure enough they didn’t.</content>

    <content>Pakistan Stands Up For Canada Amid Diplomatic Battle With India #canada #india #pakistan  India is warning its citizens traveling to Canada or living in Canada to exercise the utmost caution. They issued this warning in light of what they call “anti-India activities and politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence in Canada”. Adding that any Indians who oppose the “anti-India agenda” in Canada face threats. India, who murdered a Canadian citizen, continues to play the victim. The investigation that caught India was initially thought to be headed by the CIA and Canada, but a western intelligence official dropped a not-so-subtle hint that all of 5 eyes has been investigating the murder. Pakistan has something to say about all of this though, saying “India's terrorism in Canada is not a matter of surprise” Adding “If anyone in the world is aware of Indian terrorism, it is us” Yesterday they said India was a “terrorist and rogue state”, and asked "how long will our friends in the West continue to ignore such acts from India?”</content>

    <content>Saudi Arabia To Built A Nuke If Iran Gets One #usa #saudiarabia  Saudi Arabia said in no uncertain terms that if Iran gets a nuclear weapon then they have to get one too. The U.S.’ biggest fear regarding a nuclear Iran has less to do with Iran having a nuke but the proliferation it’ll bring to the region. As Saudi Arabia is clearly stating here they’ll build nukes, one should expect Turkey to also build nukes if Saudi gets them. A nuclear arms race in the Middle East gives the U.S. all the more reason to strike a deal with Iran.</content>
