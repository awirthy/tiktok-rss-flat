    <content>Saudi Arabia Kills Man For Tweets #saudiarabia #saudi  Saudi Arabia has sentenced a man to death for criticizing the Saudi Royal Family on Twitter. The charges against him are “betraying his religion,” “disturbing the security of society,” “conspiring against the government” and “impugning the kingdom and the crown prince”. The man had just 10 followers so he was tweeting to essentially no one. Killing people for tweets is just yet another human rights violation from the champions of crimes against humanity Saudi Arabia also funded 9/11, genocided Yemenis, aided ISIS, and killed Jamal Khashoggi.</content>

    <content>Russia Bombs Romania On Accident #russia #romania #ukraine  Russia hit Romania, a NATO member, with drones in an attack last night according to Ukraine. Romania denies this but Ukraine has released video and pictures of the drones hitting them. However Romania says that they posed no direct military threat. Russia is playing a risky game. They can’t hit the back side of a barn yet they send explosives en masse. This is at least the 2nd time Russia has bombed a NATO country by accident.</content>

    <content>France Bans Muslim Dresses In Schools #france #islam  France says it’ll be uncompromising in its ban on abayas in school. An Abaya is usually a dark cloak worn by Muslim women. The French education minister says “When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn't be able to identify a student’s religion just by looking at them” Some critics have called it discriminatory because Abayas aren’t inherently religious, they’re just a kind of dress. But Macron says French schools are secular and that teachers must enforce the ban. All religious attire and symbols are banned in French schools. Which is quite the difference from America. Here, our secularism is based on freedom of religion. It’s very individual, it’s part of the “be who you want to be” motto of America. While in France, their secularism is based on freedom from religion. It’s based on this belief that there is a collective freedom from religious institutions. It’s an interesting approach.</content>

    <content>India Is Changing Its Name To Bharat #india #bharat  India may be changing its name! A special session in parliament may rename the country to Bharat. Bharat is already the name most Indians call India so renaming it would be like Germany changing their name to Deutschland or Japan becoming Nippon. It’s common for places to have their own name and a name that everyone else calls them. For instance: China calls America a name that means “The United States of Beauty, Advantage and Endurance” And we call China “China” which is thought to mean “Land of the Qins”.</content>

    <content>Russia Wants Alliance With North Korea &amp; China #russia #korea  South Korea says that Russia has proposed a three way with North Korea and China. Under Russia’s proposal, the three of them would conduct naval exercises together. Last time, Russia and China got together for an exercise, they just did their own thing next to each other and called it a joint exercise which is not what that is. Also North Korea and Russia are currently negotiating an arms deal. 6 years ago, Russia told North Korea that if the U.S. nukes them that they’ll be justified in doing so and will have no one to blame but themselves. Now Russia is making the nuclear threats they denounced and is becoming friends with the hermit kingdom.</content>
