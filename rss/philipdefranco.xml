    <content>Israel Gives 24 Hours To Evacuate Gaza #usa #israel  Israel has told the United Nations that they have 24 hours to evacuate Northern Gaza to the south. But The UN says that its impossible to evacuate 1.1 million people in less than 24 hours. And Hamas is telling people not to evacuate, saying its propaganda according to Al-Jazeera. Israel is expected to begin its ground invasion of Gaza as soon as this weekend. Iran says that there is a real possibility of more fronts opening against Israel. Human rights Watch has accused Israel of using White Phosphorus while others have accused them of flat out revenge bombing.</content>

    <content>Terror Attack Rocks France As Israeli Invasion Is Imminent #usa #israel  Israel has told a hospital in Northern Gaza that they have two hours to evacuate according to doctors without borders. The hospital says this is just not possible. Politico says Israel’s ground invasion is imminent. The US is urging Israel to delay their imminent ground operation until safe passage for Palestinians can be secured. Meanwhile Egypt says Israel’s mass evacuation notice is a serious breach of international humanitarian law but Egypt has also taken “unprecedented measures” to reinforce its border with Gaza to prevent any breaches and is resisting pressure from the US to open a humanitarian corridor for Palestinians according to the Financial Times. Biden says it’s a priority of his to address this humanitarian crisis, and that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and the appalling attacks. France has declared a maximum security alert because a knife attack done by an Islamic terrorist in France has been linked to the events we just discussed. Macron said that the French Police thwarted another attack earlier in the day. Macron said France had been “hit once again by the barbarity of Islamist terrorism.” The UK is drawing up rules to deport foreign students, academics, and workers who commit antisemitic acts or praise Hamas.</content>

    <content>Iran Warns Israel Of Intervention #usa #israel  Iran sent a warning to Israel through the United Nations saying: that if they continue their operation in Gaza, they will intervene in the conflict according to Axios. The US has sent a second aircraft carrier to the region and has selected 2,000 troops to prepare for a potential deployment to support Israel. When asked if the US can support both Ukraine and Israel, President Biden said “We're the United States of America for God's sake. The most powerful nation in the history of the world.” He also called on Hamas to be destroyed but reiterated his support for a Palestinian state. Palestine’s President has condemned Hamas’ attacks and says that Hamas doesn’t represent the Palestinian people but then the remarks were later deleted without explanation. Israel is rushing to deploy a giant laser for the first time in the world according to Channel 14 in Israel. The giant laser is supposed to work as an air defense system. Israel and Hezbollah are continuing to exchange an increasing amount of fire with each other across the border as the situation escalates rapidly.</content>

    <content>US Gets Israel To Allow Aid To Gaza #usa #israel  After 8 hours of negotiations with Israel, the United States has convinced Israel to agree to develop a plan to let humanitarian aid flow into Gaza as well as create areas to keep civilians out of harm's way. The US warned that if Hamas tries to block or seize the aid, the US will prevent it from happening. President Biden will go to Israel tomorrow, where he will be presented with a plan from Israel on how they plan to conduct their operation in a way that minimizes civilian casualties according to the State Department. They will also present him with a briefing on their war strategy. After this, Biden will fly to Jordan where he will meet with the President of Palestine and Egypt, and the King of Jordan. The King of Jordan says that Egypt and Israel will not accept any refugees or support Israel’s operation to take out Hamas but President Biden seems determined to change that. Secretary Blinken has taken 13 trips in the past 72 hours between 8 different Middle Eastern capitals in an effort to prevent an escalation of this war.</content>
