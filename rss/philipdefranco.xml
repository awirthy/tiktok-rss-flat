    <content>Israel Strikes Refugee Camp #usa #israel  Israel has confirmed that it carried out an airstrike on Gaza’s largest refugee camp to kill a senior Hamas commander. The Wall Street Journal says Doctors estimate scores of civilians were killed in the strike. The IDF was asked by Wolf Blitzer why they would hit the camp if they knew it had  innocent refugees and civilians. And the spokesperson said: “This is the tragedy of war, wolf. We've been saying for days, move south." The Houthis have entered the conflict, according to Reuters. The Houthis, based in Yemen over a thousand miles away from Israel, say they have carried out 3 missile attacks on Israel so far. The first of these attacks was intercepted by the US navy and Saudi Arabia while the 2nd hit Egypt instead of Israel, and initial reports seem to suggest that the third attack hit Jordan by accident today.</content>

    <content>Iran Threatened With Tomahawkalypse As US Reveals Sub Location #usa #america  In a very rare announcement, the US announced the arrival of one of its most secretive assets to the Persian Gulf. A nuclear submarine. The message they’re sending is clear and the recipient of that message is Iran and it’s proxies. The USS Florida is one of four Ohio Class Submarines that carries 154 tomahawk missiles that can each carry a 1,000 pound warhead and travel up to 1,500 miles. It also deploys navy seals. These subs are known as the four horsemen of the Tomahawkalypse.</content>

    <content>Israel Conducts Space Combat In A Global First #usa #israel  Israel shot down a missile in space in what is the first recorded instance of space combat. With the Telegraph reporting that the missile was fired by Yemen’s Houthis, where it traveled out of the earth’s atmosphere and was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow. Israel has suspended a cabinet minister after he suggested nuking Gaza. Iran says that the US will be hit hard if it doesn’t implement a ceasefire in Gaza. Iranian proxies have continued to attack US bases. They’ve launched at least 40 attacks on America in the past 20 days with at least 45 US troops being injured according to NBC News. The US has conducted at least two airstrikes in response and is now calling on the Iraqi government to stop Iran’s proxies from further attacks. The King of Jordan says they worked with Israel to airdrop medical supplies to a hospital in Gaza. Israel says that its ground invasion has split Gaza in half and the IDF says that it expects to enter Gaza City within the next 48 hours. In an interview, a senior Hamas leader called North Korea an ally and suggested that one day they could intervene in the conflict. This comes after AP identified Hamas using North Korean supplied weapons in the October 7th attack. France has had more than a thousand anti-Semitic incidents since October 7th according to the French interior minister. Turkish police used tear gas and water cannons to stop pro-Palestinian protesters from storming an Air Force base that houses US troops according to Reuters. </content>

    <content>Israel To Occupy Gaza Indefinitely #usa #israel  Israel says it will occupy Gaza indefinitely after the war. Israel hasn’t occupied Gaza since 2005. In an interview, Netanyahu said he’s open to little pauses in the war to facilitate the delivery of aid or to release hostages. But he ruled out a ceasefire without the release of the hostages. Hezbollah and Israel continue to exchange fire. With Hezbollah’s leader saying in an interview with NBC News that they continue to do this to alleviate pressure on Gaza. He added that those in the Axis of Resistance believe America is the mastermind, so they strike America to send a message to stop. The Axis of Resistance is Iran’s alliance of terrorists. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah, the PIJ, and about 30 other Syrian and Iraqi militias. Hezbollah’s leader also said that they would kill an Israeli civilian for every Lebanese civilian that Israel kills but when he was asked if that meant Hezbollah would be deliberately targeting civilians he said “What we will do you will see in the press, God willing. You can start counting and you will see whether or not our calculations are correct or not.” Despite all this talk though, Hezbollah has yet to enter the war despite saying they would if Israel conducted a ground invasion into Gaza. There have now been 40 attacks in the past 3 weeks on US forces in the Middle East after two attacks last night, according to the Pentagon. However, there haven’t been any injuries or damage to bases since October 26th.</content>
