    <content>India Threatens To Kill Americans #usa #india  The FBI has visited Sikh leaders in the United States to warn them that there have been credible threats against their lives from India. This comes after India murdered a Canadian Sikh leader. Across the United States, local law enforcement is reportedly reaching out to Sikh communities with warnings regarding potential threats from India. America is India’s largest trade partner and killing an American in the US would undoubtedly result in India’s economy being completely crippled, if not military action. The US says there must be accountability from India.</content>

    <content>Russia Rejects Peace, Wants To Settle It On Battlefield #ukraine #russia  Russia has rejected Ukraine’s peace plan because they want to “settle it on the Battlefield” instead. Just this past week, Ukraine struck the Black Sea Headquarters in Crimea - killing the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. Meanwhile American tanks have finally arrived in Ukraine with Depleted uranium rounds. And while Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been moving slower than expected, their shaping operation in Crimea has seen great success.</content>

    <content>Canadian Pilot Changes Call Sign To What?! #canada #uk  Yesterday a Canadian fighter jet changed its call sign to “D**K69” while it was flying over the UK. Canada says it’s investigating the name change, adding that it was inappropriate and unapproved. Call signs contain four letters and two numbers. They are assigned to pilots and usually remain unchanged. And this Canadian pilot changed their call sign from BLDE11 to D**K69. They could be facing a stiff punishment.</content>
