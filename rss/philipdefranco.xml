    <content>Saudi Arabia Has Paid Off Vice News #vice #saudiarabia  Vice News, they were someone you could count on to give you the news that no one else was willing to cover… they have fallen. After striking a deal with a State-run Saudi Arabian media company, Vice removed their documentary that was critical of the Saudi Crown Prince. The documentary revealed how MBS orchestrates purges, kidnaps Saudi elites and tortured them, and how he killed Jamal Khashoggi. The video they removed was from June of this year but Vice’s ties to Saudi Arabia go way back. In 2018, Vice started making promotional videos for the Kingdom after Saudi gave them $200 million from the sovereign wealth fund. In 2020, they helped organize a Saudi music festival that was paid for by the Saudi government &amp; Vice hid their involvement. In 2021, they opened an office in Riyadh after previously being banned from the country. Now they’re actively seeking producers for their “new media brand” that’s headquartered in the country. Vice claims that they have full control over editorial but that seems to be a flagrant lie. This year, Vice entered into another deal with a Saudi media company and after doing so they reportedly canned a story on how Saudi Arabia was helping families harass and threaten transgender Saudis living overseas.  With the Vice Union saying that just cause the company is bankrupt financially doesn’t mean it should also be morally bankrupt. The icing on the cake here is that in Vice headquarters in London, there is reportedly a map of Saudi Arabia on the wall.</content>

    <content>US &amp; Vietnam Become Allies #usa #vietnam  The US has picked up yet another ally. With Vietnam giving the United States a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which is the highest level of diplomatic ties that they have to offer. The two will pursue strategic cooperation as well as a semiconductor supply chain that’s immune from China. They’ll also trade agricultural products. The U.S. is Vietnam's largest export market and last year it was the fastest growing economy in Asia. Despite our shared past of war, 84% of Vietnamese have a positive view of America with only 6% having a negative view. This shift by Vietnam is just as much about Vietnam’s anxiety over China as it is over a desire to make more money with America. American investors are already increasingly looking to Vietnam because of their large swath of highly educated young people who are extremely entrepreneurial in spirit. But the honeymoon phase might not last long because the US says it’ll continue to press Vietnam on human rights. Last year it said that it was neither “free nor fair.”</content>

    <content>America &amp; Canada Make China Very Mad #usa #canada  The U.S. and Canada sailed two ships through the Taiwan strait after China claimed it had total ownership over the strait. China sent three ships armed with torpedoes and missiles to flank the Canadian warship and they followed them for 17 hours. China also sent fighter jets to intercept the warships but upon realizing that the Canadian vessel wasn’t alone, it changed course. The U.S. frequently takes this route as part of it’s freedom of navigation operations. China accused these two hoodlums of trying to stir up trouble.</content>

    <content>Ukraine Destroys Russian Submarine &amp; Landing Ship #ukraine #russia  Ukraine destroyed a Russian submarine and a landing ship. Using British Storm Shadow missiles, they hit a Russian dry dock in Crimea. Both vessels have been completely destroyed. The submarine is only one of 6 that Russia has in the Black Sea, and Russia frequently uses them to fire cruise missiles at Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly said that attacking this area would result in a nuclear response. These missiles hit the same area that Elon Musk blocked Ukraine from hitting earlier in the year by turning off the internet. Ukraine’s attack would have nearly taken out the entire Russian Black Sea fleet, but General Musk blocked it. As a result of the aborted attack, the Russian Black Sea Fleet would proceed to fire hundreds of missiles at Ukrainian cities in the following months, causing widespread destruction and numerous civilian casualties. So far though, it’s been over 12 hours and Russia’s super spooky nuclear threat appears to be yet another bluff. If you’re threatening to use nukes, you’ve already lost and if you actually believe their nuclear threats - you’re a sucker. You know who also doesn’t buy the nuclear threats? The United States. They will be providing Ukraine with the Army Tactical Missile System, which fires ballistic missiles that have a range of 300 kilometers… So more strikes inside of occupied Crimea and Russia are coming.</content>

    <content>Russia Gives North Korea Nuclear Missiles #russia #korea  Kim Jong Un and Putin met in Russia today. Kim vowed “full and unconditional” support for Russia, and called Russia’s war “just”. Russia is seeking stockpiles of aging ammunition and rockets for their soviet weapons. North Korea is seeking food and missile technology for their nuclear missiles and spy satellites. Earlier this year, experts pointed out that North Korea’s nuclear missiles look an awful lot like Russian nuclear missiles which would put Russia in violation of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty if true. If Russia and North Korea do sign a deal though, it’ll violate global sanctions making Russia and North Korea subjected to even more UN-sanctioned sanctions. Kim ended the meeting by saying that “we believe with certainty that the Russian army and people will achieve a great victory in the just fight to punish the evil forces”. Uhh.. Lol.</content>
