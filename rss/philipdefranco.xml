    <content>China Demands Britain Return Stole Relics #UK #british  China has demanded that the British Museum return all of its Chinese cultural relics that it stole. Adding that the British Museum should return all of their stolen relics to their home countries like Egypt, Greece, India, and Nigeria, not just China. They say that the vast majority of their 8 million relics are stolen from other countries, and that the UK has a “bloody, ugly, shameful colonial history”. Damn they kind of ate, not gonna lie. As someone who has been to the British museum, no amount of jokes or memes can prepare you for the amount of theft inside. I was inside for not even 2 minutes when I saw the inside of a pyramid!!! They took part of the inside of one of the pyramids and brought it back to London. What they’ve done to other countries is the equivalent of them stealing our Statue of Liberty, putting it in a museum, and when we ask for it back - they say “hmm no but you can come here and see it”.</content>

    <content>China Having Meltdown Over Japan #japan #korea  China is having an absolute meltdown over Japan. Japan released treated water from Fukushima with the approval of the IAEA into the ocean with many scientists agreeing that it would have a negligible impact on the environment. This is a process that will take 30 years as they slowly release it. But China is acting like Japan unleashed a toxic plague into Asia. With China’s wolf warrior artist releasing this image depicting Japan. First China called them selfish and irresponsible. Now China says it’s blocked all seafood imports from Japan despite all testing of the water and fish showing it to be very safe. So Japan is taking China to the WTO over the seafood ban. Scientists have pointed out that China releases untreated water from its nuclear plants every day that is more radioactive than what Japan is releasing. But that has not stopped Chinese citizens from harassing Japanese businesses and schools with phone calls and throwing rocks at their embassy in China. Japan has asked China to tell its citizens to chill out &amp; China said it has no idea what Japan was talking about. Now as for Japan’s other neighbors - South Korea said that if Japan is following the regulations and doing it safely then who cares. Taiwan and the Philippines basically said whatever. But in Hong Kong, they declared Japan an enemy of the whole world.</content>

    <content>China Drops New Map Claiming India, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Russia, and Bhutan #russia #philippines #japan  China dropped it’s new map and it’s neighbors are upset. China’s new map shows them claiming part of India. India says the map is absurd and that their claims have no basis. The map also shows them infringing on Malaysia’s maritime border so Malaysia has rejected their unilateral claims. China’s map also claims part of Russia, Japan, Vietnam, Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and all of Taiwan. It may seem silly for these countries to get very upset over what are essentially just lines on a piece of paper. But lines on a map represent people’s identities, their validation, things they’ve fought thousands of years for. It’s never just a line on a piece of paper.</content>

    <content>Russia Says It Has A Right To 1v1 Each &amp; Every NATO Country #russia #usa  Russia says it has a right to war with each and every NATO country. Saying “whether you like it or not, history is on our side and we will bury you”. Russia has lost half of it’s military hardware and half a million soldiers and NATO hasn’t even shown up yet. So I say fine. If Russia wants to fight each NATO country individually, then I volunteer Hungary to go first and then Poland gets to go second.</content>

    <content>Police Pull Over Giant Bull Named Howdy Dooty Sitting In Car #usa #america  A car with a giant bull sitting in the passenger seat named Howdy Doody was pulled over by police in Nebraska. The man and Howdy Doody were pulled over after a snitch called the police about the sight. The police didn’t give him a ticket though, they just gave him some warnings and asked him and Howdy to leave the city. Turns out that Howdy Doody is actually a bit of a celebrity and performs at a lot of parades and fairs in the area.</content>
