    <content>Ukraine Destroys Russian Supersonic Bomber #ukraine #russia  Ukraine has destroyed Russia’s supersonic bomber. Now Russia claims it’s only damaged, but judging by the photo. Looks pretty bad to me. Russia called this a terrorist act but hitting a bomber on a military base is the furthest thing from terrorism. A terrorist act is hitting entire apartment buildings with missiles like this supersonic bomber has done since the beginning of the war.</content>

    <content>Algeria Blocks French Airforce #france #algeria  Algeria says France can’t fly military aircraft over the country in order to conduct a “military operation” in Niger. France responded by saying “cool, we never asked for such a thing”. 12 nigerien soldiers, as in soldiers from Niger, were killed in a terrorist ambush, that’s the 8th terrorist attack on the Army since the coup happened. Also the African Union has kicked Niger out of the union due to the coup and the new US ambassador has arrived in the country but they won’t be meeting with the Junta.</content>

    <content>Russia Killed Leader Of Wagner #russia #ukraine  Russia has killed the leader of Wagner. Russian state media says Prigo as well as at least 9 others passengers died when his jet crashed. Wagner is accusing Russia of shooting down the plane as he was leaving Moscow today. Initial flight data and video evidence seems to back that accusation. Wagner’s military commander is also reportedly among the dead. The CIA doesn’t call Putin the “ultimate Apostle of payback” for no reason.</content>

    <content>Putin Planted Bomb On Wagner Plane #russia #ukraine  US intelligence believes that a Russian anti-air missile shot down Prigo’s plane, killing all of Wagner’s senior leadership but US officials believe a bomb exploded on board. British Intelligence believes Russia’s FSB took down the plane. Either way it’s believed that yesterday’s assassination was a message to all of Russia’s elite. If Putin is willing to kill Prigo in broad daylight over Moscow.. then absolutely no one is safe. Putin has sent his condolences to Prigo’s family and he says he’s waiting for the results of the investigation.</content>

    <content>Former President Donald Trump turned himself at the Fulton County jail. This is Donald’s Trump mugshot. Trump and 18 co-defendants face a noon ET Friday deadline to voluntarily surrender after being criminally charged in the state’s 2020 election subversion case. Trump agreed earlier this week to a $200,000 bond. The order also bars him from using social media to target co-defendants or witnesses. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is asking for the trial of all 19 people to begin on October 23, an extremely ambitious schedule. Trump opposes the proposed trial date, his attorneys said this afternoon. Trump’s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, surrendered Wednesday, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows surrendered Thursday. Trump is accused in the indictment of being the head of a “criminal enterprise” that was part of a broad conspiracy to overturn his electoral defeat in the state. The former president faces 91 charges across four separate criminal cases. </content>
