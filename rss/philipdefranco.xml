    <content>Wagner Makes Mad Dash To Moscow #russia #ukraine #usa  Wagner is making a bolt to Moscow with a convoy of reportedly 400 vehicles. Russia is setting machine gun nests up around Moscow as well as attempting to block all entrances into the city. It appears as if we’re heading towards a showdown in Moscow by tonight. Putin has tried to negotiate with Wagner but they’ve rejected his attempts. Wagner is pulling equipment out of Ukraine to use in it’s war against Russia. Putin’s plane has flown out of Moscow but the Kremlin says he’s still in the city.</content>

    <content>The Russian Civil War Coup Is Over #russia #ukraine #usa  The Russian civil war Coup attempt is over… maybe? Kind of? Reports are coming out that Wagner has halted their advance to Moscow and will be returning to their bases after Lukashenko of all people struck a deal with them. The deal reportedly will see Russia's defense minister and chief general replaced while Wagner’s leader and his fighters will get total legal immunity in exchange for not overthrowing the government. If you’re confused, I can assure you that everyone is. A point of no return was reached today, they shot down 7 aircraft, occupied cities, and humiliated Putin. Russia was blowing up their own bridges and oil depots, and digging trenches in Moscow. Maybe the immediate situation is over but the crisis is just beginning. It’s now very clear how incredibly weak Putin is and you can’t get that cat back in the bag.</content>

    <content>The US Knew Of Russian Coup Plot #usa #russia  The U.S. reportedly knew Russia was about to be coup’d two weeks ago after spies uncovered the plot. In fact, Congress had reportedly been briefed on it days before it happened. This demonstrates just how big of an intelligence failure this was for Russia. The leader of Wagner has reportedly been exiled to Belarus and it’s hard to say how long that will last for. It’s still not quite clear to anyone who’s currently in charge of the Russian military or why Wagner stopped when they had it in the bag. But The U.S. believes that we haven’t seen the end of Russian turmoil and that Pandora’s box has been opened.</content>

    <content>US Called Russia During Coup #usa #russia  During Saturday’s Coup, the US called Russia. The US reportedly told them that they had nothing to do with the coup and they pushed for Russia to not use its nuclear arsenal. Lavrov added that the US really emphasized that they had had no plans to get involved in the coup and that everything that was happening was an internal affair of Russia and none of their business. But that’s about where the good will ended. Lavrov then lashed out at the US for not telling anyone about the rebellion despite knowing about it. And in fairness, he has a point.. When has Russia ever done the US wrong? And don’t say the 2016 election, Syria, cyber attacks on our power grid, the 3 invasions of Ukraine, continuous nuclear threats to us and our allies, attempts to kill US citizens, Afghanistan, downing our drones by running into them with their planes, trying to shoot down our planes, unleashing a troll farm on US social media sites, blaming us for everything that goes wrong, cheating in the olympics, hacking of us companies</content>
