    <content>Serbia Prepares Invasion of Kosovo &amp; NATO #usa #europe  Serbia could attack NATO and Kosovo soon. The US just delivered an unusually specific warning about a potential Serbian military action into Kosovo. Saying they’re monitoring a larger Serbian deployment on the border of Kosovo including an “unprecedented forward deployment and staging of artillery, tanks, and service members”. The US called on Serbia to withdraw their forces, and said that it’s destabilizing. When asked if Serbia was going to invade Kosovo, the White House said “we’re looking at it but we can’t say right now”. NATO has deployed more forces to Kosovo in light of this, and Britain has placed more troops under NATO command.</content>

    <content>US Speaker Removed For First Time In History #usa #america  For the first time in American history, the speaker of the house has been removed. Needing only 5 votes to can him, McCarthy’s fellow Republicans cannibalized him after he worked with Democrats to prevent the government from shutting down. Democrats said McCarthy wasn't a man of his word, and refused to save his speakership. Kevin was speaker for 270 days, which is about 25 Scaramuccis.</content>

    <content>Test Of Emergency Alert System Tomorrow #usa #america  Tomorrow, Wednesday the 4th, all phones, TVs, and radios in America are going to broadcast an emergency message from the President. The message will be broadcast at 2:20pm eastern time and will say “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” Your phone will vibrate and set off an emergency tone, you’ll also get a text message as well. They’re testing the national alert system so you know it exists and also so they know it works. If, god forbid, anything happens tomorrow like an alien invasion or nuclear war - the test will be delayed to the 11th.</content>

    <content>Los Angeles Trolls Saudi Arabia #usa #saudiarabia  Los Angeles has renamed an intersection for Jamal Khashoggi, the intersection is in front of the Saudi Consulate. Last year, DC renamed the street that the Saudi embassy is on to Jamal Khashoggi Way. Jamal Khashoggi was a very prevalent journalist who worked for the Washington Post, was a permanent US resident, and whose children were US citizens. Saudi Arabia murdered him inside of an embassy in Turkey at the direct order of the Saudi Crown Prince. They cut off his limbs while he was still alive and tortured him on Skype while MBS’s staff watched. After the murder, MBS reportedly was given Khashoggi’s fingers. And this is the country Joe Biden wants to name a “non-NATO major ally”.</content>

    <content>Mexico Says US Doesn’t Do Anything For Them #usa #mexico  The President of Mexico says the U.S. should send the money it’s giving to Ukraine to Latin America instead. Saying that the US doesn’t do anything for them. He also called on the US to lift sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela, adding that the sanctions are why there’s a migrant crisis. But experts say that economic mismanagement and political repression are why people are leaving, not sanctions.</content>
