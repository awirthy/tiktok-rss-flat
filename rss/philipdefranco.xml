    <content>The Russian Civil War Coup Is Over #russia #ukraine #usa  The Russian civil war Coup attempt is over… maybe? Kind of? Reports are coming out that Wagner has halted their advance to Moscow and will be returning to their bases after Lukashenko of all people struck a deal with them. The deal reportedly will see Russia's defense minister and chief general replaced while Wagner’s leader and his fighters will get total legal immunity in exchange for not overthrowing the government. If you’re confused, I can assure you that everyone is. A point of no return was reached today, they shot down 7 aircraft, occupied cities, and humiliated Putin. Russia was blowing up their own bridges and oil depots, and digging trenches in Moscow. Maybe the immediate situation is over but the crisis is just beginning. It’s now very clear how incredibly weak Putin is and you can’t get that cat back in the bag.</content>

    <content>The US Knew Of Russian Coup Plot #usa #russia  The U.S. reportedly knew Russia was about to be coup’d two weeks ago after spies uncovered the plot. In fact, Congress had reportedly been briefed on it days before it happened. This demonstrates just how big of an intelligence failure this was for Russia. The leader of Wagner has reportedly been exiled to Belarus and it’s hard to say how long that will last for. It’s still not quite clear to anyone who’s currently in charge of the Russian military or why Wagner stopped when they had it in the bag. But The U.S. believes that we haven’t seen the end of Russian turmoil and that Pandora’s box has been opened.</content>

    <content>US Called Russia During Coup #usa #russia  During Saturday’s Coup, the US called Russia. The US reportedly told them that they had nothing to do with the coup and they pushed for Russia to not use its nuclear arsenal. Lavrov added that the US really emphasized that they had had no plans to get involved in the coup and that everything that was happening was an internal affair of Russia and none of their business. But that’s about where the good will ended. Lavrov then lashed out at the US for not telling anyone about the rebellion despite knowing about it. And in fairness, he has a point.. When has Russia ever done the US wrong? And don’t say the 2016 election, Syria, cyber attacks on our power grid, the 3 invasions of Ukraine, continuous nuclear threats to us and our allies, attempts to kill US citizens, Afghanistan, downing our drones by running into them with their planes, trying to shoot down our planes, unleashing a troll farm on US social media sites, blaming us for everything that goes wrong, cheating in the olympics, hacking of us companies</content>

    <content>US Prepares For Collapse Of Russia #usa #russia #uk  The UK is making plans for Russia if it suddenly collapses. This comes after this weekend’s coup attempt. The US had also prepared plans for a range of scenarios with Russia. When we spoke to officials over the weekend, Western capitals were already starting to make plans if Wagner were to come in possession of nuclear weapons. Officials in Washington are left wondering if they witnessed an aborted coup or a thwarted mutiny. One senior European Diplomat asked “Why did it calm down so quickly, and how come Putin’s puppet Lukashenko got the credit?” Many western officials are skeptical that this is the end, with some believing that Wagner will either challenge Russia’s military from abroad or that Prigo will be killed in Belarus. Also Putin revealed today Russia had paid Wagner 68 billion rubles just this year… damn and I thought my Peloton investment was bad.</content>
