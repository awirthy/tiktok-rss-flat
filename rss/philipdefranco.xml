    <content>On The Verge Of World War: Africa #usa #france  We’re on the verge of World War: Africa. The Economic Community of West African States says that Niger has 5 days to reinstate the President or that they’ll take military force to reinstate him. With Nigeria’s military saying that if they’re called upon to reinstate the President, they will. Saying “we will defend democracy” The US says they support ECOWAS’s attempts to reverse the military takeover. But Burkina Faso and Mali, the two neighboring juntas, say they will join the war on the side of the junta. France has begun a military evacuation of its citizens and any European who wants to leave. The U.S. has around 2,000 soldiers in the country meant to train the Nigerian military but they have suspended that mission. It’s unclear if the US and French support for the coalition will be kinetic, intelligence, or just diplomatic support. There are 5 days left on the war ultimatum</content>

    <content>Another Wave Of Drones Hit Moscow #ukraine #russia  Another round of drones have hit Moscow. At least one drone hit the IQ Quarter again where Russia’s digital ministry is located. The attacks closed one of Moscow’s four airports. Russia claims that Ukraine also used naval drones to try to attack their warships but that they stopped them. It’s unclear if this is true because all they do is lie. Zelensky said earlier this week that the war is coming to Russia, a process he said was “inevitable, natural and absolutely fair.” It’s believed that the drones are being launched from the inside of Russia despite having an alleged range of 1000 kilometers. The lack of air raid sirens in Moscow has puzzled many with some wondering if the refusal to use them is to downplay the drone attacks. It does seem to at least be partially explained by Russia being potentially unable to see the drones on radar until it’s too late. However, the drones are being filmed on their flight to Moscow by civilians so one would think that visual confirmation would be enough to at least trigger the sirens. These strikes are part of Ukraine’s objective to make it clear to Russians that war is closer than they think &amp; that they can attack Moscow in hopes of causing domestic problems for Putin. Many residents of Moscow are complaining on Russian social media about the drone strikes, saying it gives them anxiety. Well at least Russians now know how their government has made Ukrainians feel every night for a year and a half.</content>

    <content>Belarusian Helicopters Cross Into Poland #usa #poland  Two Belarusian helicopters crossed into Poland earlier today violating their airspace during a training exercise. In response, Poland is deploying additional troops and combat helicopters to the border with Belarus. This comes after the US said that an attack by Wagner will be considered an attack by Russia. However the US says it’s aware of the threats Wagner is making to Poland but that it’s unaware of any credible threats to Poland.</content>

    <content>US Evacuates Embassy In Niger #usa #nigeria  The U.S. is preparing to evacuate its embassy in Niger but as of right now, its 2K troops are staying put. The junta in Niger has requested the rapid deployment of Wagner to the country. ECOWAS says the military option is the very last option on the table, but that they need to prepare for that eventuality. Nigeria has cut all electricity to the country as Niger plunges into darkness and rolling blackouts. There are 4 days left on the war deadline.</content>

    <content>Replying to @Philip DeFranco Senate Active Shooter Was Prank Call Capitol Police say that the 911 call about an active shooter may have been a “prank call”. All buildings have been cleared and Capitol Police reportedly sealed off all of the Senate’s underground tunnels. No shooter has been located and so far no injuries reported. Police are still searching but this does appear to be a false alarm.</content>
