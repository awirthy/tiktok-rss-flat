    <content>China Is Abandoning Russia #ukraine #russia  First China condemned Russia for what it said was “brutal and excessive law enforcement” after they denied 5 Chinese citizens entry. Then Russia rejected China’s 12 point peace plan earlier this year so now China believes that Russia doesn’t want peace at all. Fast forward to the peace talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend, and Chinese representatives were said to be helpful and keen to show that they weren’t Russia with China even asking to attend the next meeting that Russia wasn’t invited to, showing that Russia is becoming more isolated. And to put the icing on the cake, China praised the talks that Russia said were doomed to fail and signaled an openness to Ukraine’s 10 point peace plan that would see Russia leave the country entirely.</content>

    <content>US Trying To Prevent World War Africa #usa #nigeria  The US is taking over peace talks on World War: Africa. Niger’s Junta would only let the US’s special emissary into the country and refused entry to peace delegations from the UN and the African Union. The US’s special emissary is the deputy Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland. She’s very experienced in foreign affairs but this is actually her first week on the job. She’s trying to convince the Junta to stand down but says that the talks are “extremely frank and at times quite difficult.”. Adding that she hopes to keep the door open to diplomacy but that “their ideas do not comport with the Constitution”. She has also suspended all US aid to the country. Also Russia couldn’t control itself this morning and said that Nuland can’t trick Niger with buns in a cellophane bag like she did with Ukraine. Whatever that means.</content>

    <content>Belarus Begins Military Drills On Border With Poland and Lithuania #poland #usa  Belarus has begun military drills on the border with Poland and Lithuania. They say the drills are based on experiences from the “Special military operation”. This comes after two Belarusian helicopters flew into Poland last week. Poland and Lithuania have built up forces on the border in order to protect against Wagner and Belarus. I’m sure European Texas will have something to say about this.</content>

    <content>Russia Won’t Have A Presidential Election #russia #usa  Russia says they may not hold Presidential elections next year because Putin will obviously win re-election. Putin is expected to announce his run for a 6th presidential term, especially since he changed the constitution to let him be President until 2036. All of this, of course, doesn’t matter though because they don’t have free and fair elections. But it does raise an interesting question - we know the elections are rigged, so why not just have another fake election? Maybe he thinks that the few real votes will reveal just how weak support for him has gotten.</content>

    <content>US &amp; Saudi Near Deal To Normalize Relations With Israel #usa #saudiarabia #israel  The U.S. and Saudi Arabia reportedly have a working plan in place to normalize relations with Israel! The deal would see the US help Saudi develop a civilian nuclear program and give them iron-clad security guarantees similar to that of NATO Article 5. It would also see the creation of a Palestinian state. Now in return, Saudi would distance itself from China economically and militarily. Saudi will price oil sales to China in dollas, it’ll also drop Chinese tech, and not allow China to build a base in the country. And lastly, they’ll stop messing with oil prices. But there are some obstacles though. For one, Israel fears that a nuclear program would allow Saudi to develop nukes if Iran does and it also wants a larger US security guarantee that is also similar to NATO’s Article 5. Israel will also have to agree to help forward the Palestinian quest for statehood. And the last obstacle for this deal is at home. Such a deal would require Senate approval and Saudi is toxic. They funded 9/11, they killed a US journalist, they mess with gas prices to swing our elections and they’re ruining golf. The Senate already won’t sell more weapons to Saudi, so to get them to agree to a security guarantee like an Article 5 seems far-fetched. But the Biden Admin is hoping that the history shifting deal will be enough for lawmakers to drop opposition if and when that day comes.</content>
