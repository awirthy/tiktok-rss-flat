    <content>China Hacked US Power Grid #usa #america  China has planted malware inside of networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed US military bases all around the world. And now the U.S. is hunting for it in a panic under the belief that China could activate the code to disrupt the U.S. military in the event of conflict or when China makes a move on Taiwan. One official called it a “ticking time bomb”. If China were to use the malware, it wouldn’t just affect the bases - it would also affect regular Americans as domestic US bases use the same infrastructure.</content>

    <content>Ukraine Using North Korean Rockets To Hit Russia #ukraine #korea  Ukraine is using North Korean rockets to hit Russia. They say that a friendly nation seized them from a Russian ship and gave them to Ukraine. The friendly nation is suspected to either be the United States or South Korea. However, Ukrainians don’t like using the rockets because they have a high dud rate because they’re North Korean and nearly 40 years old. But ammo is ammo.</content>

    <content>Is Elon Helping Russia Invade Ukraine? #ukraine #russia  Elon Musk may have just helped Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Musk has explicitly intervened and refused to let Starlink be activated in occupied territories so Ukraine could conduct drone strikes in places like Crimea. Musk was concerned that such strikes would escalate the war and loss of life, even though not allowing such strikes just meant more dead Ukrainians and that ultimately such a decision was not his to make. This led to the US having to pay for specific access and control of certain Starlink systems so that Musk could get over himself and quit intervening in the war. #elonmusk #usa </content>

    <content>On The Verge Of World War: Africa #usa #france  We’re on the verge of World War: Africa. The Economic Community of West African States says that Niger has 5 days to reinstate the President or that they’ll take military force to reinstate him. With Nigeria’s military saying that if they’re called upon to reinstate the President, they will. Saying “we will defend democracy” The US says they support ECOWAS’s attempts to reverse the military takeover. But Burkina Faso and Mali, the two neighboring juntas, say they will join the war on the side of the junta. France has begun a military evacuation of its citizens and any European who wants to leave. The U.S. has around 2,000 soldiers in the country meant to train the Nigerian military but they have suspended that mission. It’s unclear if the US and French support for the coalition will be kinetic, intelligence, or just diplomatic support. There are 5 days left on the war ultimatum</content>
