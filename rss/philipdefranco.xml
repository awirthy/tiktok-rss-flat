    <content>US Navy Confronts Iran, Iran retreats #usa #america  This is footage of the U.S. Navy confronting Iran yesterday when it tried to seize two oil tankers. The Iranian Navy opened fire on one of the US-owned vessels in an attempt to get it to stop but the ship kept chugging along. At which point, the USS McFaul, a U.S. missile cruiser, went to the scene at full speed and upon arriving - the Iranian Naval vessel cut and ran.</content>

    <content>Hong-Konger Arrested For Disrespecting National Anthem #hongkong #china  Here in the US, if you don’t respect the national anthem the worst that is going to happen is you’re going to kill your football career due to faux-outrage. But in Hong Kong? Straight to jail. Chung Wing-chun just found that out after he just became the first person tried under the city’s controversial National Anthem law. Right, what Chung did was edit a video of a Hong Kong Olympic Fencer during the Tokyo Olympics awards ceremony by replacing the Chinese national anthem with the song “Glory to Hong Kong,” Which became a major protest anthem during the massive 2018-2019 protests. Many think what Chung did wasn’t even disrespectful at all, and he continues to claim that he never meant it as disrespect.| [] However, the court magistrate said that “This behavior clearly undermines the dignity of the national anthem as a symbol and sign of the People’s Republic of China.” The 27-year-old man won’t find out his sentence until July 20th, but this conviction carries upwards of three years in prison and an over $6,000 fine. [] It’s bad enough that a law like this even exists, Like sure, if people want to be so patriotic that disrespecting your country’s national anthem can kill a career then let them be. It’s stupid, but on a completely different level to actually having the government potentially throw you in prison for it.</content>
