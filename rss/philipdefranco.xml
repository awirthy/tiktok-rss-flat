    <content>The US Knew Of Russian Coup Plot #usa #russia  The U.S. reportedly knew Russia was about to be coup’d two weeks ago after spies uncovered the plot. In fact, Congress had reportedly been briefed on it days before it happened. This demonstrates just how big of an intelligence failure this was for Russia. The leader of Wagner has reportedly been exiled to Belarus and it’s hard to say how long that will last for. It’s still not quite clear to anyone who’s currently in charge of the Russian military or why Wagner stopped when they had it in the bag. But The U.S. believes that we haven’t seen the end of Russian turmoil and that Pandora’s box has been opened.</content>

    <content>US Called Russia During Coup #usa #russia  During Saturday’s Coup, the US called Russia. The US reportedly told them that they had nothing to do with the coup and they pushed for Russia to not use its nuclear arsenal. Lavrov added that the US really emphasized that they had had no plans to get involved in the coup and that everything that was happening was an internal affair of Russia and none of their business. But that’s about where the good will ended. Lavrov then lashed out at the US for not telling anyone about the rebellion despite knowing about it. And in fairness, he has a point.. When has Russia ever done the US wrong? And don’t say the 2016 election, Syria, cyber attacks on our power grid, the 3 invasions of Ukraine, continuous nuclear threats to us and our allies, attempts to kill US citizens, Afghanistan, downing our drones by running into them with their planes, trying to shoot down our planes, unleashing a troll farm on US social media sites, blaming us for everything that goes wrong, cheating in the olympics, hacking of us companies</content>

    <content>All Of South Korea Just Got 2 Years Younger! #southkorea #korea  All South Koreans are now a year or two younger as of today. South Korea has adopted the international age system that the rest of the world uses that states that when babies are born, they are 0 years old. With South Korea’s old age system, when a baby was born they were 1 year old and on every New Year’s Day, they aged 1 year. So if you were born on New Years Eve, you’d be two years old despite only being two days old! What an interesting way to do pension reform. #korean </content>
