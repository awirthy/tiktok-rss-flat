    <content>Kevin McCarthy is now floating the idea of impeaching President Biden over the family’s business dealings. #JoeBiden  While speaking on Sean Hannity’s show last night, the House Speaker discussed House Republican’s investigation into the business dealings of Biden’s family members — and in particular, Hunter Biden. Right, for a while now, Republicans have been investigating several unproven claims of financial misconduct. This including claims from two IRS whistleblowers who said the DOJ improperly intervened in the probe into Hunter Biden’s taxes by making it too lenient. As well as an uncorroborated FBI document they claim shows that Biden’s family received payments from foreign companies. Those investigations haven’t gained much traction — probably because all the claims Republicans have made are… still totally unsubstantiated. But despite that, McCarthy has now seriously escalated the situation, discussing various parts of the investigations and telling Hannity: “If you are sitting in our position today, we would know none of this if Republicans had not taken the majority. We only followed where the information has taken us. But, Hannity, this is rising to the level of impeachment inquiry, which provides Congress the strongest power to get the rest of the knowledge and information needed. Because this president has also used something we have not seen since Richard Nixon: used the weaponization of government to benefit his family and deny Congress the ability to have the oversight.” Now, to use the technical political term: them’s fightin’ words. #KevinMcCarthy  #Fox  #Politics</content>
