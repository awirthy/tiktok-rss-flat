    <content>Democrats are pushing to stop the practice of “judge shopping,” which allows plaintiffs to essentially pick judges sympathetic to them. #Politics  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and 17 other dems wrote a letter urging the policymaking body for the judicial system — the Judicial Conference — to end a system for assigning cases that basically allows plaintiffs to select their own judges. Aka, judge shopping. Specifically, the group is pushing the Judicial Conference to change single-judge divisions, which allows for ALL federal cases filed in certain geographic regions to be assigned to just one judge — And specifically, a judge that is sympathetic to the case, effectively allowing plaintiffs to pick what judge they want by filing their lawsuit in a specific division. With the senators explaining in their letter that this creates an unbalanced system because plenty of other districts assign cases to judges randomly, writing: “Based on geography, some plaintiffs are able to guarantee that their claims will be heard before a specific judge, whereas others are left to chance. This inconsistency undermines Americans’ faith in our judicial system.” The letter also goes on to flag single-judge districts in Texas, pointing to the Northern District of Texas as a particularly egregious example. Noting that, even though there are more than a dozen judges in the district, “civil cases are filed in many divisions are always assigned to a single judge, or to one of just a few.” And that is very significant because this goes beyond just cases that impact Texas — right, this has major implications on federal policies that affect all Americans. #US  #Texas  #Court</content>

    <content>Fox News is being sued for defamation AGAIN, but this time, it’s by a Trump supporter. #Politics  Okay, so let’s break this down — because it’s a real weird one. Right, this whole story centers around a man named Ray Epps who was at pro-Trump rallies in D.C. in January 2021 but is not known to have stormed the Capitol. But Epps still gained widespread attention because of two separate video clips. The first, which was taken the day before the insurrection, Epps is seen arguing with the far-right live-streamer “Baked Alaska.”  And there, he can be heard encouraging Trump supporters to enter the Capitol during the planned protests the next day. Right, and the second clip of Epps was actually taken on January 6th in front of the Capitol. And there, he’s seen speaking with another protestor, who moments later joined others in breaching the police barricade in front of the Capitol. Then, a few days after the insurrection, the FBI uploaded a picture of Epps on its website and indicated it was seeking information about him. But the agency eventually removed the picture several months later in July after interviewing Epps, and he was not ultimately prosecuted by the Justice Department. So those factors, combined with the videos, became the basis of a far-right conspiracy that Epps was a federal agent who was trying to get Trump supporters to commit crimes. #FoxNews  #TuckerCarlson  #US</content>

    <content>The Biden administration will cancel $39 billion in student loan debt for 804,000 Americans. #Politics  Now, of course, that is much less than Biden’s initial effort to forgive $400 billion in loans for tens of millions of borrowers. But with that shutdown by the Supreme Court last month, his options are much more limited. So, with that said, who qualifies for the new forgiveness? Well, this new policy specifically targets the 8 million Americans who use what are known as income-driven repayment plans — or IDR plans. Under those programs, student loan borrowers make payments that are capped at a percentage of their income. And after they have paid a certain amount of time — Typically either 20 or 25 years, depending on their plan — they are eligible to have their remaining debt forgiven. But few people actually have their loans forgiven under these programs. And that’s in large part because, for decades, the loan servicers that collect payments from people with IDR plans have made many mistakes. Improperly tracking payments made by borrowers that should have helped them qualify for forgiveness. What’s more, servicers also gave people IDR programs horrible guidance and advice that prevented them from making qualifying payments, including improperly steering them into long-term forbearances. #US  #Money  #StudentLoans</content>

    <content>It looks like Trump is about to be federally indicted AGAIN. #DonaldTrump   The former president said in a post on Truth Social that he received a letter from special counsel Jack Smith this weekend informing him that he’s a target of a federal criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. With Trump writing calling Smith “deranged” and claiming the special counsel gave him “a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment.” And, I mean, he’s not wrong there… when someone gets a letter from the DOJ telling them they are the target of a probe, it is usually a really good sign they are about to be indicted. Right, this is actually something we talked about before when it was first reported that Trump had been informed he was a target in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe. But, for some quick catch-up here, “target” is actually a technical term that the DOJ defines as a person “to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime.” With DOJ specifically encouraging prosecutors to send so-called “target letters” in cases where people are likely to be indicted so they get the opportunity to testify before the grand jury in their probe. And, very notably, Trump was in fact indicted on federal charges about a week after it was reported he had gotten a target letter for the Mar-a-Lago inquiry. So, in other words, it seems likely that Trump is going to be indicted in the Jan. 6 probe in a matter of days or weeks. #US  #Politics  #JackSmith</content>
