    <content>Democracy is on the line in Ohio, and there’s just a few hours left to vote. #Ohio  #Election  #Vote  #Politics  Ohio voters are heading to the polls for a special election today where democracy itself is on the line. The very surface-level TLDR is basically that the special election is being held for people to vote on Issue 1 — a measure that will make it harder to pass constitutional amendments by ballot initiative. The measure achieves this in a few ways, but the most significant is that it would raise the number of votes required to approve a constitutional amendment from 50% to a 60% supermajority. So, in other words, 59% of voters can want an amendment, and a minority can undermine the democratic will of that huge majority. And if that sounds like minority rule, it’s because it’s literally minority rule.</content>

    <content>ProPublica Finds Clarence Thomas Accepted Even More Gifts #ClarenceThomas  That includes: “At least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” But the report explicitly states that even THAT “it is almost certainly an undercount.” #political  #US  #Propublica</content>
