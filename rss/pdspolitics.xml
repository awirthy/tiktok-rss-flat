    <content>Trump could be on the verge of not one but two more indictments #Trump  Trump could be on the verge of yet ANOTHER indictment. Right, two grand juries are being seated in Georgia today to decide if Trump and/or any of his allies will face criminal charges in their effort to overturn the 2020 election in the state. And this is a big deal because it marks the beginning of the end for the massive, sweeping investigation that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis launched more than two years ago now. What’s more, it also represents one of the last of the remaining major legal threats hanging over Trump’s head. With Willis suggesting in the past that any indictments will come in August. And, if Trump is indicted, it would mark the third time in just the last year. Right, and on that note, this also comes as Trump is now asking that the trial for the Mar-a-Lago documents case be postponed indefinitely. With his lawyers arguing in a filing that starting the trial in December as the DOJ has requested would be “unrealistic” because of all the preparations they need to do and could “result in a miscarriage of justice.” And if a delay is approved, it could push the trial to the final stages of the 2024 campaign or even beyond. #US  #Politics  #Georgia</content>
