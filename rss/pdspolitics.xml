    <content>ProPublica has discovered that Supreme Court Judge Samuel Alito failed to disclose luxury gifts from a Republican mega donor who he later heard cases for. #SupremeCourt  But this story doesn’t stop there. Alito declined ProPublica’s request for comment when the outlet sent him a detailed list of questions. But he DID respond to the allegations in a totally bizarre Wall Street Journal op-ep titled: “ProPublica Misleads Its Readers.” And I really can’t understate how weird this is for a few reasons. Right, first of all, as Slate explains: “It is rare (and may in fact be unprecedented) for a sitting court justice to attack a media outlet in print—or to engage in any kind of published advocacy at all.” But beyond that, maybe the weirdest part of all is that this op-ed was published several hours BEFORE the ProPublica report even came. #US  #Politics  #SCOTUS</content>

    <content>Three Supreme Court justices just voted to “upend democracy,” but they were stopped by the rest of the court. #SupremeCourt  The high court struck down an INCREDIBLY consequential and controversial case in a 6-3 ruling. The case in question was called Moore v. Harper, and we actually did a deep dive on it a little while ago which I’ll link to down below. But the very top-level TLDR is that centers around Republican gerrymandering in North Carolina. North Carolina Republicans took the matter to the Supreme Court after multiple Congressional maps they drew were rejected because of gerrymandering.  But this wasn’t a typical gerrymandering case: the Republican’s argument rested entirely on a totally untested, fringe theory touted by Trump and other far-right extremists in their effort to overturn the 2020 election called Independent State Legislature theory. The basis behind ISL theory is that the Constitution gives state legislatures pretty much the exclusive power to set election rules and congressional maps. But not only is that authority singular, nothing can stop them — there can be no intervention from state courts, governors, or voters. I mean, we’re talking about a case where North Carolina literally argued that legislatures would even violate their own state Constitutions! #US  #Politics  #MooreVHarper</content>

    <content>The Supreme Court has now upended affirmative action. #AffirmativeAction  The conservative Supreme Court has once again upended decades of past precedent. This morning, the high court officially struck down Affirmative Action, ruling that race-conscious admissions are unconstitutional in cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina. With, of course, all conservatives voting in favor and all liberals dissenting. Though, notably here, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case because she had been on the school's board of overseers. And while this is not at all unexpected, it is still massively consequential. This ruling will TOTALLY change the admissions process as we know it, forcing both private and public universities to dramatically transform the way they select students and build diverse campuses. Right, for more than four decades, Affirmative Action has been a core tenant of higher education and the main tool colleges — and particularly selective schools — have used in their pursuit of a diverse student body. #US  #Politics  #SupremeCourt</content>
