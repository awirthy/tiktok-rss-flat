    <content>The Biden administration will cancel $39 billion in student loan debt for 804,000 Americans. #Politics  Now, of course, that is much less than Biden’s initial effort to forgive $400 billion in loans for tens of millions of borrowers. But with that shutdown by the Supreme Court last month, his options are much more limited. So, with that said, who qualifies for the new forgiveness? Well, this new policy specifically targets the 8 million Americans who use what are known as income-driven repayment plans — or IDR plans. Under those programs, student loan borrowers make payments that are capped at a percentage of their income. And after they have paid a certain amount of time — Typically either 20 or 25 years, depending on their plan — they are eligible to have their remaining debt forgiven. But few people actually have their loans forgiven under these programs. And that’s in large part because, for decades, the loan servicers that collect payments from people with IDR plans have made many mistakes. Improperly tracking payments made by borrowers that should have helped them qualify for forgiveness. What’s more, servicers also gave people IDR programs horrible guidance and advice that prevented them from making qualifying payments, including improperly steering them into long-term forbearances. #US  #Money  #StudentLoans</content>

    <content>It looks like Trump is about to be federally indicted AGAIN. #DonaldTrump   The former president said in a post on Truth Social that he received a letter from special counsel Jack Smith this weekend informing him that he’s a target of a federal criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. With Trump writing calling Smith “deranged” and claiming the special counsel gave him “a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment.” And, I mean, he’s not wrong there… when someone gets a letter from the DOJ telling them they are the target of a probe, it is usually a really good sign they are about to be indicted. Right, this is actually something we talked about before when it was first reported that Trump had been informed he was a target in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe. But, for some quick catch-up here, “target” is actually a technical term that the DOJ defines as a person “to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime.” With DOJ specifically encouraging prosecutors to send so-called “target letters” in cases where people are likely to be indicted so they get the opportunity to testify before the grand jury in their probe. And, very notably, Trump was in fact indicted on federal charges about a week after it was reported he had gotten a target letter for the Mar-a-Lago inquiry. So, in other words, it seems likely that Trump is going to be indicted in the Jan. 6 probe in a matter of days or weeks. #US  #Politics  #JackSmith</content>

    <content>Michigan just brought the FIRST-ever criminal charges against fake electors that tried to overturn the 2020 election. #Politics  Yesterday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged 16 Republicans who falsely claimed to be the presidential electors in 2020 in an effort to get Trump elected in the state. And the charges here are hefty, with Nessel slapping all 16 with eight criminal counts including forgery, conspiracy to commit forgery, and election law forgery —  Some of which carry sentences of up to 14 years in prison. Specifically, court documents released after the charges were announced detail how the 16 Republicans met and filled out paperwork claiming they were Michigan’s official electors and that Trump had won the election. This despite the fact that Biden had actually won by 150,000 votes, courts had already thrown out lawsuits that claimed Trump had won, and leaders in the legislature had made it clear they would not challenge the results further. #US  #Trump  #Michigan</content>

That is what a group of more than three dozen lawmakers argued in a letter urging the Biden administration to change federal laws that allow law enforcement to access sensitive medical data without a warrant. #US  #Biden  #BigBrother</content>
