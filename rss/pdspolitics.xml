    <content>Texas is ripping libraries out of schools and turning them into “discipline centers.” #Texas  A judge in Arkansas temporarily blocked a law that would have made it a crime for librarians and booksellers to give minors “harmful” materials. And so last month, a group of booksellers and libraries filed a lawsuit, arguing that elements of the new law were unconstitutional. With the groups also claiming that the law presented them with an impossible situation. And the judge agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction where he argued the law would: “permit, if not encourage, library committees and local governmental bodies to make censorship decisions based on content or viewpoint, which would violate the First Amendment.” Right, and this is just one state of many where conservative makers are trying to ban and restrict access to books. And some places are finding really unique ways to do this. Right, recently, Texas’ largest public school district in the state — Houston Independent School District — announced that it is eliminating school librarians at 28 schools, And converting the libraries into discipline centers for kids with behavior problems. And this isn’t just a few schools — the move will apply to 28 different schools, with the district saying an additional 57 schools will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. #BookTok  #BookBan  #Politics</content>

    <content>China &amp; Russia used Microsoft to hack the US government, and Microsoft might have known it had serious flaws the whole time. #Microsoft  Microsoft is under heavy scrutiny after both China and Russia managed to use vulnerabilities in their products to hack the United States government. The most recent hack was announced by Microsoft yesterday, and involved Russian hackers linked to their foreign intelligence service using Microsoft 365 accounts to trick Microsoft Teams users. Using their compromised 365 accounts, the hackers set up official-looking technical support-themed domains and sent Teams messages to a ton of people directing them to the fake websites. Once there they’d be asked to login and grant approval on their Microsoft multi-factor authentication app. But in reality, it was the hackers who needed that authentication code to get access to the target's account. Once in, they had full access and used it to access sensitive information at various global organizations and even US government agencies.#Tech  #Politics  #US</content>
