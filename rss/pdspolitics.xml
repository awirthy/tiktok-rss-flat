    <content>According to former President Trump’s own lawyer, he only “asked” for the election to be overturned, he didn’t actually do it. #Trump   Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election weren’t criminal because he didn’t DIRECT Mike Pence to throw out Biden’s legitimate win, he just ASKED him nicely! That’s what Trump’s lawyer John Lauro argued during an interview with CNN last night, seemingly previewing what Trump’s defense will be in the new federal case against him. With Lauro claiming that Trump's attempts to get Pence to toss the slate of electors and pause the certification of the election amounted to free speech protected under the First Amendment: “Asking is aspirational. Asking is not action. It’s core free speech. The press should be defending free speech.” #Politics  #US  #Election</content>

    <content>ProPublica Finds Clarence Thomas Accepted Even More Gifts #ClarenceThomas  That includes: “At least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” But the report explicitly states that even THAT “it is almost certainly an undercount.” #political  #US  #Propublica</content>
