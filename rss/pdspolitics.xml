    <content>Michigan just brought the FIRST-ever criminal charges against fake electors that tried to overturn the 2020 election. #Politics  Yesterday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged 16 Republicans who falsely claimed to be the presidential electors in 2020 in an effort to get Trump elected in the state. And the charges here are hefty, with Nessel slapping all 16 with eight criminal counts including forgery, conspiracy to commit forgery, and election law forgery —  Some of which carry sentences of up to 14 years in prison. Specifically, court documents released after the charges were announced detail how the 16 Republicans met and filled out paperwork claiming they were Michigan’s official electors and that Trump had won the election. This despite the fact that Biden had actually won by 150,000 votes, courts had already thrown out lawsuits that claimed Trump had won, and leaders in the legislature had made it clear they would not challenge the results further. #US  #Trump  #Michigan</content>

    <content>Wesleyan University says it will end legacy admissions following SCOTUS overturning affirmative action. #Wesleyan  Should college applicants be given a boost in admissions because a member of their family went to the same school? That’s a question many are asking after the Supreme Court overturned Affirmative Action. So-called legacy admissions have been criticized for years now for favoring rich, white applicants over people of color. But that practice has come under even more attack since the Supreme Court decided that schools can’t consider race in admissions. And it seems like, increasingly, more and more people agree that legacy admissions are unfair. Right, top politicians on both sides of the aisle — including President Biden himself — have come out against this practice. And polls have consistently shown that the public agrees. And it seems like some schools are actually taking that to heart. Right, the reason we’re talking about this today is because the esteemed liberal arts school Wesleyan University announced that it would be ending legacy admissions. With this following in the footsteps of other selective schools that have recently made the same move including Amherst, Johns Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon. #AffirmativeAction  #College  #Politics</content>

    <content>Democrats say Republicans in Alabama are so determined to undermine Black voters that they’re now defying the Supreme Court. #Politics  Right, last month, the conservative high court made an absolutely shocking 5-4 decision to uphold a lower court ruling that tossed Alabama’s Congressional map on the grounds that it discriminated against Black voters and violated the Voting Rights Act. This because, despite the fact that nearly a third of voters in the state are Black, the GOP had drawn its Congressional map so just one of the state’s 7 districts had a Black majority.  And, of course, as part of that decision, the Supreme Court directed Alabama to comply with a federal court order to re-draw the map so at least TWO districts had at least close to a majority of Black voters. But apparently, that’s too complicated for the tiny brains of the Alabama GOP. Because Republicans in both the State House and Senate passed two different maps this week — and NEITHER sets up another district Black residents make up a majority or near-majority of voters. This notably despite the fact that Democrats literally drew a map that would make another Black-majority district, but Republicans shot it down in favor of their own versions. #US  #Vote  #Politics</content>

    <content>Millions of U.S. military emails with very sensitive contents have been sent to the country Mali — a big ally of Russia and employer of the Wagner group, all because of a simple typo… #Russia  The Pentagon confirmed that instead of using the military’s domain for emails which is “.MIL” (M-I-L), people are incorrectly typing “.ML” (ML) — which is the domain for Mali. Now, notably, according to reports:  “None of the missent emails have been marked classified, but many contain highly sensitive information about American military personnel and installations, including base staff lists, medical data, and identity documents.” But still, the Dutch internet entrepreneur who has contracted to manage Mali’s country domain for the last decade told reporters that he first noticed this issue when he first started working on the domain and has tried to repeatedly warn U.S. authorities. #US  #Politics  #Military</content>
