    <content>Illinois’ Child Influencer Law Falls Short #Illinois   Illinois has become the first state to set up financial protections for child influencers. The law was just signed on Friday, and per the Associated Press, it will: “entitle child influencers to a percentage of earnings based on how often they appear on video blogs or online content that generates at least 10 cents per view.” This specifically falls under the state’s Child Labor Law and applies to children under the age of 16. And the adult vloggers or influencers responsible for posting this content, primarily the child’s parents, would have to maintain a record of appearances and set aside earnings in a trust account that the kid can access once they turn 18, And if they don’t do that, the kid can sue. To qualify, a child would reportedly have to be in at least 30% of the content over a 30-day period. With the AP noting that many states already have rules similar to this for children in more traditional forms of entertainment like film and TV, but this is the first to go after online content, which has obviously just blown up in popularity, especially with kids. #Influencer #US  #Politics</content>
